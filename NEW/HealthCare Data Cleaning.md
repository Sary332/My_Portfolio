/* Problems : Inconcistency, Format (Date of admission, Discharge date, Billing Amount), Outliers (Hospital), 
NULL Values, Duplicate*/


# 1. Name Column 

### a) Correct inconsistencies UPPER & LOWER Case
Fix the inconsistency in name formatting. In this case, I considered several options, such as using the UPPER or LOWER function. However, I found the results to be less tidy and likely to cause excessive query repetition. Therefore, I decided to create a custom function using UDFâ€”while also sharpening my newly acquired UDF skills. This approach allows the query to be more concise, clean, and reusable for other columns that require consistent formatting.


- Method 1 (Using UPPER/LOWER)
```sql
SELECT UPPER(LEFT(NAME, 1)) + LOWER(SUBSTRING(NAME, 2, LEN(NAME)))
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET Name = UPPER(LEFT(NAME, 1)) + LOWER(SUBSTRING(NAME, 2, LEN(NAME)))
```


- Method 2 (Using UDF)
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.CapitalizeWords (@input VARCHAR(MAX))
RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @output VARCHAR(MAX) = LOWER(@input); --- Convert all letters to lowercase
    DECLARE @i INT = 1;
    DECLARE @len INT = LEN(@output);

    --- Capitalize the first letter
    SET @output = STUFF(@output, 1, 1, UPPER(SUBSTRING(@output, 1, 1)));

    --- Implement a Loop to capitalize the first letter of each word
    WHILE @i <= @len
    BEGIN
        IF SUBSTRING(@output, @i, 1) = ' ' --- Check for spaces
        BEGIN
            SET @output = STUFF(@output, @i + 1, 1, UPPER(SUBSTRING(@output, @i + 1, 1)));
        END
        SET @i = @i + 1;
    END

    RETURN @output;
END;

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET Name = dbo.CapitalizeWords(Name);
```

### b) Ensure consistent formatting for names with titles like MR., MRS., DR., and MISS 

```sql
-- Remove the title in front of the name to ensure all names are consistent with the original name, just like other patients.

SELECT NAME,
       CASE WHEN NAME LIKE '%. %' THEN SUBSTRING(NAME,CHARINDEX('. ' , Name)+2, LEN(NAME))
            WHEN NAME LIKE 'MISS %' THEN SUBSTRING(Name, CHARINDEX(' ', Name) + 1 , LEN(name))
            ELSE Name
       END AS CORRECT_NAME
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset1]
WHERE NAME LIKE 'MR.%'
        OR NAME LIKE 'MRS.%'
        OR NAME LIKE 'DR,%'
        OR NAME LIKE 'MISS%'
```
<img width="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20529314-9f87-4f9f-ad5c-67b722e51ab3" />

```sql
-- Update with fixes

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET NAME =  CASE WHEN NAME LIKE '%. %' THEN SUBSTRING(NAME,CHARINDEX('. ' , Name)+2, LEN(NAME))
                 WHEN NAME LIKE 'MISS %' THEN SUBSTRING(Name, CHARINDEX(' ', Name) + 1 , LEN(name))
                 ELSE NAME END
            WHERE NAME LIKE 'MR.%'
               OR NAME LIKE 'MRS.%'
               OR NAME LIKE 'DR,%'
               OR NAME LIKE 'MISS%'

-- Update using the previously created function to maintain consistency

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET Name = dbo.CapitalizeWords(Name);
```

# 2. 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' columns  

Standardize the date format in the 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' columns YYYY-MM-DD

```sql
---  Date of Admission

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
ALTER COLUMN [Date of Admission] DATE

--- Discharge Date

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
ALTER COLUMN [Discharge Date] DATE
```

# 3. Hospital column 

Fix misspellings and variations in the 'Hospital column'. In this column, I found many inconsistencies, such as messy name formatting with misplaced or excessive punctuation.

- Corrections 
```sql
SELECT Hospital,							
	   CASE WHEN Hospital LIKE 'and %_, %' THEN SUBSTRING(Hospital, 5, CHARINDEX(',',Hospital) - 5) + ' and'
                                                   + SUBSTRING(Hospital, CHARINDEX(',', Hospital) + 1, LEN(Hospital)) 
												
                WHEN Hospital LIKE 'and %,' THEN SUBSTRING(Hospital,5,LEN(Hospital) - 5) 
                                               + SUBSTRING(Hospital,CHARINDEX(',',Hospital) + 1, LEN(Hospital))			
											  
                WHEN Hospital LIKE '% and%_,' OR Hospital LIKE '% and%_,%' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,',','')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '%, and' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,', and','')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '%, and %' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,', ',' ')
			
                WHEN Hospital LIKE 'and %' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,'and ','')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '%_, %_ and' THEN REPLACE(LEFT(Hospital,LEN(Hospital) - 4), ',', ' and')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '% and' and Hospital NOT LIKE '%, and' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,' and','')

		ELSE Hospital
            END AS Clean_Hospital_Name
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
```

                ELSE Hospital END
```

# 4. Billing Amount Column

Fix the format to consistently show 2 decimal places for better readability. 

```sql
SELECT CAST(ROUND([Billing Amount], 2) AS DECIMAL (20,2))
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET [Billing Amount] = CAST(ROUND([Billing Amount], 2) AS DECIMAL (20,2))
```

# 5. Handle duplicate values 

After checking, it turned out that there were many duplicate records that, upon further analysis, had identical information in all columns except for the **'Age' column**. This means that the patient's name, illness, admission date, and even discharge date were all the same, except for 'Age'. Such cases are actually very rare or may almost never happen in real life (I even asked my sister, who works in a hospital ICCU). However, since I know this is synthetic data, I will just take it as a learning experience.


```sql
WITH Duplicate_Check AS (

-- Check Duplicate

/* The reason I used **GROUP BY** on all columns except 'Age' is that, otherwise, there could be up to four patients with
the same name appearing with the same room number or blood type and so on, even though they are actually different patients.
Therefore, to accurately identify them as distinct individuals, I needed to differentiate them using more detailed information. */

SELECT Name,
     --Age
       Gender,
      [Blood Type],
      [Medical Condition],
      [Date of Admission],
       Doctor,
       Hospital,
      [Insurance Provider],
      [Billing Amount],
      [Room Number],
      [Admission Type],
      [Discharge Date],
       Medication,
      [Test Results],
       COUNT(*) AS Num_Duplicate 
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
WHERE Name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Name ,Gender, [Blood Type],[Medical Condition], [Date of Admission],
         Doctor, Hospital, [Insurance Provider], [Billing Amount], [Room Number],
        [Admission Type], [Discharge Date], Medication,[Test Results]
HAVING  COUNT(*) > 1
),

/*I need to quantify the age variance caused by these duplicate entries (11,000 cases) to determine the most effective 
deduplication methodology. This statistical assessment will inform data remediation strategy. */

Age_Variance_Check AS (
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset] H
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 
               FROM Duplicate_Check DC 
               WHERE DC.Name = H.Name 
                   AND DC.[Room Number] = H.[Room Number] 
                   AND DC.[Date of Admission] = H.[Date of Admission]
                   AND DC.[Discharge Date] = H.[Discharge Date]
                   AND DC.Gender = H.Gender
                   AND DC.[Medical Condition] = H.[Medical Condition]
			 )
--ORDER BY Name 

)

SELECT Name, MAX(AGE) - MIN(AGE) AS Age_Different
FROM Age_Variance_Check
GROUP BY Name,Gender, [Blood Type], [Medical Condition],[Date of Admission],[Room Number], [Discharge Date]    
ORDER BY Age_Different DESC
```


After checking, it turns out that the largest age difference is only about 5 years, so I decided to use 
MEDIAN instead of AVERAGE. Why is Median Better than Average (Avg) for This Case? Median is Not Affected by Outliers. 
If the age difference is small (example: [30, 31]), the median and average are almost the same. But if there is an input error 
(example: [30, 60]), the median (45) is safer than the average (45). 


- Step 1: Identify duplicates and calculate the median

```sql
--- 1. Apply median values directly in the update

WITH MedianData AS (
    SELECT 
        Name,  
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY Age) OVER (
            PARTITION BY [Name], [Gender], [Blood Type], [Medical Condition], [Date of Admission],
                        [Doctor], [Hospital], [Insurance Provider], [Billing Amount], [Room Number],
                        [Admission Type], [Discharge Date], [Medication], [Test Results]
        ) AS MedianAge
    FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
    WHERE Name IS NOT NULL
	--ORDER BY Name
)

UPDATE H
SET H.Age = M.MedianAge
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset] H
JOIN MedianData M ON H.Name = M.Name;
```

- Step 2 : Remove one of the two duplicate records, as I want to keep only a single entry.
```sql
WITH RecordsToDelete AS (
    SELECT 
        Name,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY [Name], [Gender], [Blood Type], [Medical Condition], [Date of Admission],
                        [Doctor], [Hospital], [Insurance Provider], [Billing Amount], [Room Number],
                        [Admission Type], [Discharge Date], [Medication], [Test Results]
            ORDER BY Name  -- -- or another column as a tie-breaker
        ) AS RowNum
    FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
    WHERE Name IS NOT NULL
)

DELETE FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
WHERE Name IN (SELECT Name FROM RecordsToDelete WHERE RowNum > 1)
```

<br><br>

# 6. Handling NULL Values 

- Check the number of null values

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Rows,
       COUNT(NAME) AS Total_NonNull,
       COUNT(*) - COUNT(NAME) AS Null_Count
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
```

After checking, I found around 1,000 null values, and these nulls exist across all columns. So, I have a few options: delete them, 
leave them as null, or replace them with other values. But I think Iâ€™ll go with the third option.

```sql
UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET Name = ISNULL(Name,'0'),
    Age = ISNULL(Age,'0'),
    Gender = ISNULL(Gender,'0'),
    [Blood Type] = ISNULL([Blood Type],'0'),
    [Medical Condition] = ISNULL([Medical Condition],'0'),
    Doctor = ISNULL(Doctor,'0'),
    Hospital = ISNULL(Hospital,'0'),
    [Insurance Provider] = ISNULL([Insurance Provider],'0'),
    [Billing Amount] = ISNULL([Billing Amount],'0'),
    [Room Number] = ISNULL([Room Number],'0'),
    [Admission Type] = ISNULL([Admission Type],'0'),
    [Discharge Date] = ISNUlL([Discharge Date],'0'),
    Medication = ISNULL(Medication,'0'),
    [Test Results] = ISNULL([Test Results],'0')
```
