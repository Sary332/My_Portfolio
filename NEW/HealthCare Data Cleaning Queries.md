/* Problems : Inconcistency, Format (Date of admission, Discharge date, Billing Amount), Outliers (Hospital), 
NULL Values, Duplicate*/


# 1. Name Column 

### a) Correct inconsistencies UPPER & LOWER Case
Fix the inconsistency in name formatting. In this case, I considered several options, such as using the UPPER or LOWER function. However, I found the results to be less tidy and likely to cause excessive query repetition. Therefore, I decided to create a custom function using UDFâ€”while also sharpening my newly acquired UDF skills. This approach allows the query to be more concise, clean, and reusable for other columns that require consistent formatting.


- Method 1 (Using UPPER/LOWER)
```sql
SELECT UPPER(LEFT(NAME, 1)) + LOWER(SUBSTRING(NAME, 2, LEN(NAME)))
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET Name = UPPER(LEFT(NAME, 1)) + LOWER(SUBSTRING(NAME, 2, LEN(NAME)))
```


- Method 2 (Using UDF)
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.CapitalizeWords (@input VARCHAR(MAX))
RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @output VARCHAR(MAX) = LOWER(@input); --- Convert all letters to lowercase
    DECLARE @i INT = 1;
    DECLARE @len INT = LEN(@output);

    --- Capitalize the first letter
    SET @output = STUFF(@output, 1, 1, UPPER(SUBSTRING(@output, 1, 1)));

    --- Implement a Loop to capitalize the first letter of each word
    WHILE @i <= @len
    BEGIN
        IF SUBSTRING(@output, @i, 1) = ' ' --- Check for spaces
        BEGIN
            SET @output = STUFF(@output, @i + 1, 1, UPPER(SUBSTRING(@output, @i + 1, 1)));
        END
        SET @i = @i + 1;
    END

    RETURN @output;
END;

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET Name = dbo.CapitalizeWords(Name);
```

### b) Ensure consistent formatting for names with titles like MR., MRS., DR., and MISS 

```sql
-- Remove the title in front of the name to ensure all names are consistent with the original name, just like other patients.

SELECT NAME,
       CASE WHEN NAME LIKE '%. %' THEN SUBSTRING(NAME,CHARINDEX('. ' , Name)+2, LEN(NAME))
            WHEN NAME LIKE 'MISS %' THEN SUBSTRING(Name, CHARINDEX(' ', Name) + 1 , LEN(name))
            ELSE Name
       END AS CORRECT_NAME
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset1]
WHERE NAME LIKE 'MR.%'
        OR NAME LIKE 'MRS.%'
        OR NAME LIKE 'DR,%'
        OR NAME LIKE 'MISS%'

-- Update with fixes

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET NAME =  CASE WHEN NAME LIKE '%. %' THEN SUBSTRING(NAME,CHARINDEX('. ' , Name)+2, LEN(NAME))
                 WHEN NAME LIKE 'MISS %' THEN SUBSTRING(Name, CHARINDEX(' ', Name) + 1 , LEN(name))
                 ELSE NAME END
            WHERE NAME LIKE 'MR.%'
               OR NAME LIKE 'MRS.%'
               OR NAME LIKE 'DR,%'
               OR NAME LIKE 'MISS%'

-- Update using the previously created function to maintain consistency

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET Name = dbo.CapitalizeWords(Name);
```

# 2. 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' columns  

Standardize the date format in the 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' columns YYYY-MM-DD

```sql
---  Date of Admission

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
ALTER COLUMN [Date of Admission] DATE

--- Discharge Date

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
ALTER COLUMN [Discharge Date] DATE
```

# 3. Hospital column 

Fix misspellings and variations in the 'Hospital column'. In this column, I found many inconsistencies, such as messy name formatting with misplaced or excessive punctuation.

- Corrections 
```sql
SELECT Hospital,							
	   CASE WHEN Hospital LIKE 'and %_, %' THEN SUBSTRING(Hospital, 5, CHARINDEX(',',Hospital) - 5) + ' and'
                                                   + SUBSTRING(Hospital, CHARINDEX(',', Hospital) + 1, LEN(Hospital)) 
												
                WHEN Hospital LIKE 'and %,' THEN SUBSTRING(Hospital,5,LEN(Hospital) - 5) 
                                               + SUBSTRING(Hospital,CHARINDEX(',',Hospital) + 1, LEN(Hospital))			
											  
                WHEN Hospital LIKE '% and%_,' OR Hospital LIKE '% and%_,%' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,',','')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '%, and' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,', and','')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '%, and %' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,', ',' ')
			
                WHEN Hospital LIKE 'and %' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,'and ','')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '%_, %_ and' THEN REPLACE(LEFT(Hospital,LEN(Hospital) - 4), ',', ' and')

                WHEN Hospital LIKE '% and' and Hospital NOT LIKE '%, and' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,' and','')

		ELSE Hospital
            END AS Clean_Hospital_Name
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
```

                                                      + SUBSTRING(Hospital, CHARINDEX(',', Hospital) + 1, LEN(Hospital))

                    WHEN Hospital LIKE '% and' and Hospital NOT LIKE '%, and' THEN REPLACE(Hospital,' and','')

                ELSE Hospital END
```

<br><br>

# 4. Billing Amount Column

Fix the format to consistently show 2 decimal places for better readability. 

```sql
SELECT CAST(ROUND([Billing Amount], 2) AS DECIMAL (20,2))
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]

UPDATE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
SET [Billing Amount] = CAST(ROUND([Billing Amount], 2) AS DECIMAL (20,2))


# Billing Amount           
----------------
    18856.28
    33643.33
    27955.1
    37909.78
    14238.32
      ...

```

# 5. Handle duplicate values 

DATA DEDUPLICATION PROCESS :
1. Added unique ID since the table lacks a primary key
2. Calculate median age for each duplicate group
3. Used ROW_NUMBER() with ORDER BY ID to ensure consistent ordering
4. Only deleted rows with row_num > 1

```sql
/*
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
ADD ID INT IDENTITY(1,1)

# 6. Handling NULL Values 

- Check the number of null values

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Rows,
       COUNT(NAME) AS Total_NonNull,
       COUNT(*) - COUNT(NAME) AS Null_Count
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]

# Total_Rows   Total_NonNull   Null_Count
------------  --------------  -----------
   51,000        50,000          1,000
```

After checking, I found around 1,000 null values, and these nulls exist across all columns. So, I have a few options: delete them, 
leave them as null, or replace them with other values. But I think Iâ€™ll go with the first option bcuz these records contained no analyzable data and occupied storage unnecessarily.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
WHERE NAME IS NULL
```

```SQL
DELETE FROM [dbo].[healthcare_dataset]
WHERE NAME IS NULL
```
