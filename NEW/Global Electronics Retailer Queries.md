## 1. What types of products does the company sell, and where are customers located ?
```SQL
-- Types of products 

SELECT DISTINCT(Category) 
FROM [dbo].[Products]

#   Category          
----------------
TV and Video  
Audio  
Home Appliances  
Computers  
Cell phones  
Games and Toys  
Cameras and camcorders  
Music, Movies and Audio Books



SELECT DISTINCT(Subcategory) 
FROM [dbo].[Products]

#     SubCategory          
-------------------------
Bluetooth Headphones  
Home & Office Phones  
Printers, Scanners & Fax  
Microwaves  
Projectors & Screens  
        ...



-- Customers located

SELECT DISTINCT(Country),
       COUNT(DISTINCT State) AS [States / Regions]
FROM [dbo].[Customers]
GROUP BY  Country
ORDER BY  [States / Regions]

#    Country       [States / Regions]
----------------   ------------------
Australia                  8  
Netherlands                12

United Kingdom             288

```

## 2. Are there any seasonal patterns or trends for order volume or revenue ?

### a) Weekly Patterns (US 2017 Example)
     
```SQL
/* 
   Weekly pattern analysis with 5-week moving average.
*/

SELECT 
    DATEPART(WEEK, S.Order_Date) AS WeekOfYear,
    AVG(SUM(S.Quantity)) OVER (ORDER BY DATEPART(WEEK, S.Order_Date) ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS MovingAvgOrders,
    AVG(SUM(S.Quantity * P.Unit_Price_USD)) OVER (ORDER BY DATEPART(WEEK, S.Order_Date) ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS MovingAvgRevenue
FROM Sales S
LEFT JOIN Products P ON S.ProductKey = P.ProductKey 
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[Customers] C ON S.CustomerKey = C.CustomerKey
WHERE YEAR (S.Order_Date) = 2017 AND C.Country = 'United States'
GROUP BY DATEPART(WEEK, S.Order_Date)--, YEAR(S.Order_date) 
ORDER BY  MovingAvgOrders DESC


WeekOfYear  MovingAvgOrders  MovingAvgRevenue
----------  ---------------  ---------------
    52          471              134232.56
    1           467              154149.73
    53          423              121222.88
    51          366              112936.24
    2           355              116975.45
    43          327              94106.44
    50          309              98716.98
   ...          ...                ...

```

**Findings:**

- Order peaks occur in the last weeks of December and first week of January
- Increase aligns with revenue, indicating Christmas and New Year period influence
- Consistent pattern from 2016-2020 shows stable annual trends


### b) Holiday Patterns (Christmas Example)

```sql
-- Pre-Christmas period analysis (December 20-31)

SELECT 
    YEAR(S.Order_Date) AS Year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(S.Order_Date) = 12 
             AND DAY(S.Order_Date) BETWEEN 20 AND 31 
             THEN S.Quantity END) AS PreChristmasOrders
FROM Sales S
LEFT JOIN Products P ON S.ProductKey = P.ProductKey 
GROUP BY YEAR(S.Order_Date)
ORDER BY Year

Year    PreChristmasOrders
------  -----------------
2016          1808
2017          2544
2018          4284
2019          5125
2020          1316
2021          NULL

```
**Key Findings:**
- Steady year-over-year growth from 2016 (1,808 orders) to 2019 (5,125 orders)
- In 2020 Likely impacted by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions
- NULL values, indicating Incomplete data collection.


### c) Purchase Trends by Country During Holiday / Big Celebration Months

```SQL
/* 
   Analysis of offline/Online purchases during major holiday months (February, September-December for Valentine's, Thanksgiving, Christmas)
*/

SELECT 
    YEAR(S.Order_Date) AS Year,
    MONTH(S.Order_Date) AS Month,
    C.Country,
    P.Subcategory,
    SUM(S.Quantity) AS QUANTITY
FROM Sales S
LEFT JOIN Products P ON S.ProductKey = P.ProductKey 
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[Customers] C ON S.CustomerKey = C.CustomerKey
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[Stores] ST ON S.StoreKey = ST.StoreKey
WHERE S.StoreKey != 0   -- S.StoreKey = 0
  AND MONTH(S.Order_Date) IN (2, 9, 10, 11, 12)
GROUP BY YEAR(S.Order_Date), P.Subcategory, C.Country, MONTH(S.Order_Date)
ORDER BY QUANTITY DESC


Year  Month      Country     Subcategory   Quantity
----  -----   -------------  ------------  --------
2019   12     United States   Movie DVD      600
2020   2      United States   Movie DVD      504
2019   12     United States   Desktops       495
2018   12     United States   Movie DVD      482
2019   10     United States   Movie DVD      451
2019   9      United States   Movie DVD      437
2019   2      United States   Movie DVD      425
...   ...         ...           ...          ...

```

**Additional Findings:**

- February purchase increase (Valentine's Day)
- Significant October-November spikes in US and Canada (Thanksgiving)
- Christmas/New Year period shows the most consistent annual peaks for each country
- For 5 consecutive years, the best-selling product has always been the 'Movie DVD' subcategory, which also includes DVD players 
- Different patterns observed across countries based on local culture/celebrations



### d) Seasonal/Quarterly Breakdown Analysis

```

**Identified Growth Patterns for GrowthCategory:**

1. Growth Strong
   - Quantity and Revenue show positive growth
   - Example: 2018 Q1 (Qty +49.96%, Rev +53.91%)

2. Growth Risky
   - Quantity increases but Revenue decreases
   - Only occurred in 2017 Q1 (Qty +2.07%, Rev -6.79%)
   - Maybe bcus Possible price discounts/cuts ?

3. Decline
   - Both Quantity and Revenue decrease
   - Occurred in all quarters of 2020 except Q1
   - Is it due to COVID-19 lockdown, supply chain issues, or internal factors ?

4. No Baseline Data
   - First year data (2016) cannot be compared (no previous year for reference)



```SQL

/* ASP Analysis 2020 :

- Is the decline in revenue proportional to the quantity?
- If ASP is stable, it means the issue lies purely in volume.

*/

SELECT 
    [YEAR],
    [QUARTER],
    QUANTITY,
    REVENUE,
    ROUND(REVENUE/NULLIF(QUANTITY, 0), 2) AS ASP
FROM COBA4
WHERE [YEAR] = 2020
ORDER BY [QUARTER];


QUARTER   QUANTITY     REVENUE         ASP
-------   --------   -------------   --------
  1       18,483     4,971,321.35     268.96
  2       6,688      1,859,551.96     278.04
  3       4,795      1,309,883.78     273.18
  4       4,497      1,153,875.05     256.59
```
- Although quantity dropped significantly in Q2â€“Q4 2020, ASP remained relatively stable.
- This indicates that the company may have maintained pricing (did not offer major discounts) despite the drop in demand.

## 3. How long is the average delivery time in days? Has that changed over time ?
