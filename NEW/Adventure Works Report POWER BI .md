## **KEY INSIGHTS**

### 1. **Overall Strong Financial Performance**

* **Total Revenue:** \$24.9M

* **Total Profit:** \$10.5M

  > The profit margin appears healthy (\~42%), indicating good cost efficiency.

* **Total Orders:** 25.2K

* **Return Rate:** 2.2%

  > This return rate is relatively low, meaning most products are well-received by customers.

<br>

### 2. **Significant Uptrend in Revenue**

* The *Revenue Trending* chart shows **steady and strong growth**, especially after mid-2021.
* Latest monthly revenue is **\$1.83M**, an increase of +3.31% from the previous month.

  > This indicates consistent growth, likely driven by effective product or marketing strategies.

<br>

### 3. **Slight Drop in Monthly Orders**

* Last month's orders: **2,146**, slightly down from the previous month (**2,165**, -0.88%).

  > Even though revenue increased, the number of orders decreased slightly. This may be due to higher average order values or more premium products being purchased.

<br>

### 4. **Top Product Categories**

* **Accessories (17K orders)** is the best-selling category, followed by **Bikes (13.9K)** and **Clothing (7K)**.

  > Focusing on Accessories could deliver strong ROI due to high volume.

<br>

### 5. **Most Ordered and Most Returned Product Types**

* **Most Ordered Product Type:** *Tires and Tubes*
* **Most Returned Product Type:** *Shorts*

  > While *Tires and Tubes* are in high demand, *Shorts* experience high returns. This may point to issues with sizing, quality, or mismatched product expectations.

<br>

### 6. **Products with Highest Return Rates**

* **Sport-100 Helmet (Red & Blue)** have the highest return rates (3.31%).
* **AWC Logo Cap** also stands out with a 3.33% return rate.

  > These products may have potential issues with quality, sizing, or customer expectations that should be investigated.

<br>

## ✅ **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

* Consider bundling or upselling to increase average order value.

### C. **Boost Order Volume**

* Although revenue is rising, order volume has dropped slightly. Launch promotions to attract new buyers or introduce loyalty programs to increase purchase frequency.

### D. **Reduce Returns in Clothing**

* Since *Shorts* have the highest return rate by type, improve size guides, product material descriptions, and provide clearer product images.

### E. **Continuously Monitor High-Return Products**

* Develop a dedicated dashboard to track return trends by SKU and category over time.

## ⛳ Product Focus: **Sport-100 Helmet, Red**

### Context & Importance :

Among the top 10 best-selling products in the AdventureWorks catalog, the **Sport-100 Helmet, Red** stands out — not just for its high order volume and revenue, but for a critical issue that risks eroding its long-term profitability: an **exceptionally high return rate of 3.33%**, the highest in its category.

This analysis dives into the underlying performance, return behavior over time, and actionable steps to mitigate the risk — transforming this product from a revenue driver with liabilities into a more stable and profitable asset.



### Performance Highlights :

The product has performed **strongly in terms of demand**:

* **2,099 total orders**, placing it **#5** in overall order volume
* **\$73,444 in revenue**, ranked **#2** among the top 10
* But with a **return rate of 3.33%**, this product generates more returned units than any other top product

Despite its commercial potential, the **monthly KPIs reveal underperformance** relative to expectations:

* Orders: **47 vs target 54**
* Revenue: **\$1,645 vs target \$1,886**
* Profit: **\$1,029 vs target \$1,181**

This underperformance is likely **driven by return-related losses**, as refunds, restocking, and logistics eat into margins.



### Return Rate Trend – What the Data Reveals :

A closer look at the return rate trend from 2021–2022 reveals **volatile and concerning behavior**:

* In **Q1 2022**, return rates spiked dramatically — **exceeding 30%** at their peak.
* This was preceded by a relatively stable period in **late 2021**, where return rates hovered around **10%**, showing that **the product can perform consistently under the right conditions**.
* After the spike, the rate gradually declined, but **never stabilized**, and showed another uptick around **May–June 2022**.

These spikes likely stem from:

* **Post-holiday returns** (gifting mismatch)
* **Product quality inconsistencies** across production batches
* **Sizing misunderstandings** or inaccurate product descriptions
* Potential **regional misalignment**, where helmet sizing or regulations don’t match customer expectations (e.g., Australia vs Europe)



### ⚠️ Key Challenges Identified :

* **Profitability erosion** due to high return rates
* **Inconsistent customer experience**, risking trust and satisfaction
* **Unmet performance targets**, despite strong demand
* **Operational inefficiencies**, possibly tied to QA or product-market fit



## ✅ Recommendations & Next Steps :

To address both performance underachievement and return volatility, the following multi-pronged strategy is recommended:

### 1. Deep-Dive Return Investigation

* Survey customers who returned this helmet to capture **why** (size, comfort, expectation mismatch, safety perception, etc.)
* Cross-check return timing with **batch production records**
* Localize feedback (e.g., Are returns higher in the Pacific than in Europe?)

### 2. Fix Sizing and Product Communication

* Add a detailed **helmet sizing guide** with measurements in cm/inches
* Include **fit suggestions** (e.g., snug/loose fit) and **model visuals**
* Clarify any safety compliance by region (e.g., certifications for AU/EU/US markets)

### 3. Quality Control & Batch Audits

* Flag this SKU for **enhanced quality assurance**, especially if spikes align with specific production periods
* Consider doing **smaller batch releases** post-fix to validate improvements

### 4. Strategic Pricing & Bundling

* Simulated scenarios show that **a 5–10% price increase** does not heavily impact adjusted profit
* Consider bundling with accessories (e.g., pads, gloves) to increase perceived value and reduce standalone return risk

### 5. Monitoring & Early Warning Triggers

* Set up **weekly alerts** if return rates exceed a 15% threshold
* Link return data to customer service reports, product reviews, or channel-specific behavior


### Summary :

> The **Sport-100 Helmet, Red** presents a classic case of a high-potential product undermined by operational blind spots. It sells well, generates strong revenue, and is clearly in demand — but without intervention, its **volatile return pattern** threatens both margins and customer experience.
>
> By improving product communication, enhancing QA, segmenting return causes, and strategically adjusting price and bundling, this product can evolve from a risk to a resilient revenue engine.
