The dashboard is designed to:

‚úÖ **Monitor Year-to-Date (YTD) performance** against Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) benchmarks.

‚úÖ **Analyze country, product, and account-level contributions** to overall business results.

‚úÖ **Identify trends and underperforming areas** using dynamic visualizations.

* **Metric Switcher (Gross Profit, Sales, Quantity):** Allows users to toggle between KPIs, automatically updating all visuals and titles.
* **Year Filter:** Enables selection of 2023 or 2024 data.
* **Performance Indicators:** Shows YTD, PYTD, variance (YTD vs PYTD), and GP% (Gross Profit Margin).
* **Key Features :**

  * Treemap of Bottom 10 Countries: Highlights underperformers with negative variance.
  * Explore performance variance using a drillable waterfall chart (Month ‚Üí Country ‚Üí Product).
  * Trend Chart by Month and Product Type: Stacked column chart (Indoor, Outdoor, Landscape) with PYTD line overlay.
  * Scatter Plot Account Segmentation
  * DAX Measures: Custom calculations for dynamic metric switching and variance analysis.

This dashboard empowers stakeholders to quickly assess financial health, investigate key drivers of performance, and make informed business decisions.

## What the Problem It Tries to Solve ?
In the business context, the dashboard addresses these key challenges:

1. **Unexplained Variance in Performance:**

   * Management notices that Gross Profit, Sales, or Quantity fluctuates across months or years, but lacks clarity on **why**.
   * There is no easy way to break down and attribute these variances to specific **countries, products, or accounts**.

2. **Identifying Underperforming Areas:**

   * Some countries, product lines, or customer accounts may consistently drag down overall performance.
   * Without visibility, underperforming segments go unnoticed until quarterly or annual reviews, which is too late for corrective action.

3. **Prioritizing Business Actions:**

   * The business needs to know **where to focus sales or cost optimization efforts**‚Äîwhether at the market level (Country), product level, or customer level.
   * Decision-makers require a **clear picture of which areas are driving growth and which are eroding margins**.


### The Core Business Question It Tries to Answer:

> **‚ÄúWhat are the key drivers behind the changes in Gross Profit, Sales, or Quantity, and which countries, products, or customers are helping or hurting our performance compared to last year?‚Äù**


### ‚úÖ How This Helps:

The dashboard enables the business to:

* **Quickly detect issues** (e.g., declining profit in specific countries or products).
* **Analyze variance drivers** (drill from Month ‚Üí Country ‚Üí Product to find root causes).
* **Make informed strategic decisions** (e.g., adjust pricing, focus on high-margin products, reduce exposure to unprofitable markets).
* Transition from **reactive** to **proactive** performance management.

## What Kind of Insight It Brings ?

<details>
  <summary>Gross Profit 2023‚Äì2024</summary>
  
### ‚úÖ Overall KPI Highlights
> Overall, total Gross Profit (YTD) dropped from 5.15M in 2023 to 1.40M in 2024 for the same period. However, the YTD vs PYTD gap improved
  significantly from -265K to -78K, indicating that the downward trend has been successfully mitigated. Gross Profit Margin remained relatively
  stable at around 39%, showing that margin structure is well maintained.


### ‚úÖ Monthly Trend
> Monthly trends show sharp fluctuations. In 2023, declines were consistent in Q4, while in 2024 there was a positive spike in February (+117K)
  before declining again in March‚ÄìApril. This highlights the need for a more consistent month-on-month improvement momentum going forward.


### ‚úÖ Product Type Performance
> Outdoor products continue to support growth amid weaknesses in Indoor & Landscape. In 2024, Outdoor recorded a net +44K while other products declined.  
  This signals an opportunity to expand Outdoor‚Äôs market share in the right segments.


### ‚úÖ Country Breakdown
> Country analysis shows that some major contributors dropped sharply, such as Canada (-41K), Germany (-25K), and Japan (-19K). Conversely, markets
  like Poland, Qatar, and Thailand posted positive growth, albeit on a smaller scale.  
> **Recommendation**: strengthen strategies in declining markets and scale up in growing ones.‚Äù


### ‚úÖ Account Segmentation
> The profitability segmentation scatter plot illustrates where accounts sit in terms of value (YTD sales) and profitability (GP%). Most accounts
  remain clustered in the Low Value‚ÄìLow GP% quadrant, highlighting a concentration of lower-contributing accounts. A few accounts are beginning to
  shift toward higher GP% areas, though their overall value is still modest. This segmentation helps visualize opportunities for prioritization‚Äîaccounts
  with high GP% but lower volumes could be targeted with up-sell and cross-sell strategies to move them into the High Value‚ÄìHigh GP% quadrant.


### ‚úÖ Slide 6 ‚Äî Actionable Key Takeaways
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Maintain margins** ‚Äî control pricing & costs.  
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Drive volume** ‚Äî future Gross Profit growth hinges on account & key market penetration.
