A. Description

In the scope of the Data Analytics course, following scenario was set: As a junior data analyst we should help

E. Results and Recommendation

a) This analysis has allowed us to form observations in terms of the difference between casual and member rides.

   • Casual riders tend to borrow more on weekends. 
   • Casual riders use docked bikes almost exclusively. 
   • Casual riders are borrowing longer. 
   • The percentage of member and casual riders is highest in Q2 and Q3 
   • Many casual riders start their borrow near Lakeshore Drive, an interstate highway. 

b) Recommendations Based on the insights gathered, I am recommending the following additional action points:

  1. At the onset, we can come up with a communication campaign (email, Text Messages, app marketing) exclusive 
     to casual riders offering them a limited-time promo (discounts) when they convert to an annual membership subscription.

    • Comms will be released on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to coincide with the busiest days for the casual cohort.
    • Place special offers for anyone who registers for the annual membership from November to February.

  2. There may also be a need to look at pricing and determine which is more cost-efficient between casual and annual membership. 
     If it turns out that annual membership is more cost-efficient in the long run, this may be communicated in the campaign as well.

  3. Conduct qualitative study (interview) with casual riders to further understand their motivations/behavior. This is to:

    • Confirm our hypothesis that casual riders are reliant on bike-sharing as their primary mode of transportation.
    • Come up with a customer persona to which we will base our marketing campaign.
