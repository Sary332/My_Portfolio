### 📅 2. Do Seasons Shape Sales Patterns?

#### >>> 📈 Seasonal Peaks

The data reveals a clear pattern:

* Orders and revenue **peak in late December and early January**—driven by **Christmas and New Year celebrations**.
* Secondary spikes appear in February (Valentine’s Day) and October-November (Thanksgiving in the US and Canada).

From 2016–2019, these trends remained **remarkably consistent**, highlighting predictable demand cycles.

#### >>> 🛑 2020: A Disrupted Year

The pandemic left its mark. Despite the holiday season, 2020 saw a **decline in order volume**, though the **average selling price (ASP) remained stable**—suggesting the company held pricing power and avoided deep discounting.

#### >>> 📊 Quarterly Performance

* **Strong Growth (e.g., Q1 2018):** +49.96% in quantity, +53.91% in revenue.
* **Risky Growth (e.g., Q1 2017):** Quantity up, but revenue down—possibly due to heavy discounting.
* **Declines (2020):** Likely linked to **lockdowns and supply chain issues**.

### 🛫 3. Holiday Season Product Trends

#### >> 🥇 Top Performers Over 6 Years :

* **Desktops** dominated revenue, leading in 4 out of 6 years.
* **Movie DVDs** ruled unit sales every single year.
* **Laptops and Touch Screen Phones** surged in 2020–2021, likely due to **work-from-home demand**.

But the pandemic also hit hard:

* Movie DVD revenue fell sharply, though unit sales stayed high.
* Across categories, 2020 saw **volume and revenue drops**, yet some product lines like **Laptops** rose in relevance.

---

### 🚚 4. How Fast Are Deliveries?

Logistics improvements tell a success story:

* Average delivery time dropped from **7 days in 2016 to 3 days in 2021**.
* Maximum delivery time fell from **17 to 8 days**.
* Variability decreased—by 2021, delivery performance was **consistent even during Q4 peaks**.

This suggests investments in **supply chain and fulfillment operations paid off**, allowing the company to handle holiday surges efficiently.

### 🛒 5. What Do Customers Buy Together?

#### >>> 🎯 Cross-Selling Opportunities

* **Movie DVDs are an anchor product**: appearing in 5 of the top 6 product pairings and 8 times in the top 20.
* Often paired with:

  * Desktops
  * Bluetooth Headphones
  * Boxed and Download Games
* Recommendation: use DVDs as a **loss leader** to drive bundles and upsell home entertainment setups.

#### >>> 💡 Untapped Potential

* **Desktops + Touch Screen Phones** combo (Rank #11) could be marketed together.
* **Televisions + Movie DVDs** (Rank #14) is underleveraged—ripe for bundle promotions.
